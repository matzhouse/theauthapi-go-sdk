# theauthapi-go-sdk

OpenSource SDK for the Auth API

This package provides the core functionality for interacting with TheAuthAPI.

## Usage

Import the package:

```go
import "github.com/seventy6/theauthapi-go-sdk"
```

Each service file (`api_keys.go`, `projects.go`, `accounts.go`) should implement the specific API endpoints for that service, following the structure you've defined in your client.
